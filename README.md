# Solitaire (React + Tailwind)

A learning-focused Klondike Solitaire project built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

This repository is organized for step-by-step delivery with tests written along the way.

## Goals

- Learn practical frontend architecture with React and TypeScript.
- Implement drag-and-drop card interactions.
- Build a rules-driven game engine separated from UI.
- Use tests as milestone gates to verify progress.

## Tech Stack (planned)

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Vitest
- React Testing Library
- `@dnd-kit/core` (drag-and-drop)

## Development Approach

- Build in milestones.
- Define acceptance criteria before implementation.
- Write tests with each feature (logic first, then UI behavior).
- Keep game logic in pure functions to make testing simple.

## Core Game Variant (MVP)

- Klondike Solitaire
- Single-card draw from stock

## Out of Scope (initially)

- Scoring and timer
- Fancy animations
- Undo/redo history
- Hint system
- Persistent saves

## Documentation Map

- Architecture and state model: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Milestone roadmap: `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- Task checklist with status: `TASKS.md`

## Run / Test

These commands are placeholders until project scaffolding is added:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
pnpm test
```
